## âš¡Vite
- Vite is a modern **build tool** and development server that allows you to create web applications in a simple, fast, and modular way.
- It is a modern alternative to tools like Create React App (CRA), Webpack, or Parcel.
- It uses native ES Modules (ESM) in the browser and requires minimal configuration to get started.

## ðŸš€ Why use Vite?
- Instant startup: No initial bundling needed.
- Blazing fast Hot Module Replacement (**HMR**): Only reloads updated modules without a full page refresh.
- Optimized production build using Rollup under the hood.
- First-class support for modern frameworks such as React, Vue, Svelte, Preact, Lit, etc.
- Extensible with plugins, including Rollup plugins.
- Faster and leaner compared to older tools like Create React App.

## JSON
- JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.
- It is language-independent and widely used for data exchange between a server and a web application.
- JSON is often used in APIs to send and receive data.
- It does not support comments
- JSONC (JSON with Comments) is a variant of JSON that allows comments, but it is not a standard format and may not be supported by all parsers.

### JSON Syntax
- JSON data is represented as key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces `{}`.
- Keys must be strings enclosed in double quotes `""`.
- Values can be strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, or null.
- Arrays are ordered lists of values enclosed in square brackets `[]`.
- We have always to end with a comma `,`
- JSON supports the following data types:
  - String: `"Hello, World!"`
  - Number: `42`
  - Boolean: `true` or `false`
  - Array: `[1, 2, 3]`
  - Object: `{"key": "value"}`
  - Null: `null`

### JSON Parts
- The fist part contains information about the project, such as the name, version, and description.
- devDependencies: These are packages that are only needed during development and testing, such as testing libraries or build tools (eslint).

### Types are made of devDependencies
- This means that when we use typescript, we need to convert the code to javascript.
- This is done by using the command `tsc` (TypeScript Compiler) to compile TypeScript code into JavaScript code.
- Usually it's transpiled automatically when we run the project.

### Libraries
- There are two libraries
    - React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
    - ReactDOM: A library that provides DOM-specific methods for React.

### npm run dev vs npm run build
- `npm run dev`: This command starts the development server and allows you to see your changes in real-time.
- `npm run build`: This command creates an optimized production build of your application, which can be deployed to a web server.
